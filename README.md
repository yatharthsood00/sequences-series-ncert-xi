# sequences-series-ncert-xi

WIP repo for practicing Python. If you're here, you must be one hell of a stalker. Or, the few people who took the link to this repo from me.

Still, if you want to know what I am doing: This repo is a collection of all problems from Chapter 9, Sequences and Series, solved using Python 3.x, from the [NCERT Textbook of Mathematics, Class XI](http://ncert.nic.in/textbook/textbook.htm?kemh1=9-16).
